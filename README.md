# We Rise Hands-On Introduction to Keras

Welcome and Congrats!  You are about to embark on a fascinating journey full of suprises.  Why suprises?  Have I placed some easter eggs in this project?  No, but with Neural Networks, the results are often unique, and as you will see, sometimes funny.

In this workshop, we will cover some basic background on ConvoNets and Image Classification, run Keras locally, work through some example code and lastly, train and run a model on data youâ€™ve collected.
